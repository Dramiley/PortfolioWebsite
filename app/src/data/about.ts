        "Hello, I'm Robin Morgenstern. I'm currently studying for a master's degree in computer science and working both as a student assistant and as a freelance software developer. ",
        "In my student assistant position, I am primarily involved in AI development and the automation of a Raspberry Pi system to support the maintenance of industrial machines. Technically, I mainly work in the full-stack and backend areas as well as in machine learning. ",
        "I love breaking down problems, automating processes, and finding creative ways to make them more efficient. I am fast, eager to experiment, and enjoy familiarizing myself with complex systems. ",
