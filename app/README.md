# Robin Morgenstern - Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Project Status

**Current State:** Initial Setup
The project is currently in the initial setup phase. The core framework is in place, but the custom UI components and content integration are yet to be implemented.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized version of the site in the `.next` folder.

## Hosting

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Project Structure
